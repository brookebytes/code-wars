//Make a function that does arithmetic! - 7kyu
// Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them. 

function arithmetic(a, b, operator){
  switch (operator){
    case 'add':
      return a + b;
    case 'subtract':
      return a-b;
    case 'multiply':
      return a*b;
