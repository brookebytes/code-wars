# Codewars Challenges - **https://www.codewars.com/users/brookered**
This repository consists of coding challenges (kata) found on Codewars, where I aim to push 5 solutions per week. I currently have completed 150+ challenges and am in the top 13.5% Honor percentile.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** JavaScript

## Optimizations
I optimize my solutions to be as efficient or simple as possible, but sometimes the code is written specifically to how the kata was set up.

## Lessons Learned:
Working on so many kata has helped me learn to think in different and creative ways to solve a soltuion, learn to better optimize my code and to consistently practice and improve my programming skills!
